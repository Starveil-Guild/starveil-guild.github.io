title: Guild Loot and Distribution
date: November 7th, 2024

During guild raid periods, all Epic loot drops will be sent guild storage to be distributed to eligible members of the guild in need.

## Distribution
The process to determine the recipient of an item is as follows:

* A thread is created for each item in the [loot-distribution](https://discord.com/channels/1292680546916372530/1303134932369150024) channel.
* Eligible members can then roll on the item thread with the command `/roll 1d100`.
  * **A first roll is a final roll.** Any attempts to delete and re-roll will result in disqualification.
* After a 3-day period, the thread will close and no more rolls can be made.
* After closing, the item recipient is determined as follows:
  * Eligible members who participated in the event where the item was dropped are considered first!
    * Of those members, the member with the highest roll receives the item.
  * If no event participants roll, the next eligible member with the highest roll receives the item.

## Eligibility
To qualify for an item from guild storage:
* You must be active in our Discord server.
* You must be level 50.
* You must have at least 1,000 guild reputation.
* You must **not** have won a roll in the last week.
* You must have entered your build info on the [member roster](https://discord.com/channels/1292680546916372530/1292681234304204913/1304515086831845457).
  * You must genuinely need the gear for your build.
  * You must **not** have changed your target build in the last 2 weeks.

## FAQs
### How is a "genuine need" determined?
The member roster includes details about each members' desired target build. it will be referenced to determine need.

It is **not** currently considered a need if you're trying to fill your lithograph book.

### What if I want to change my target build?
You may change your target build once every 3 weeks.

You become ineligible to receive any items that are presently in guild storage at the time you make the change.

You are also ineligible for items the guild acquires in the following 2 weeks.

### What if I can't participate in events?
We will periodically review the raid schedule and try to accommodate as many members as possible. You may still be eligible for a drop if no one who participated in the event needs the item.

### What if the guild acquires a drop accidentally?
If you received a drop that was sent to guild storage outside of a guild event, reach out to the guild leader or advisors to receive your item.

### Why use Discord for loot distribution?
Loot distribution happens on Discord for two reasons: 
1. Everyone is made aware an item is available—even if they weren’t online when it dropped.
2. To encourage participation on Discord which is essential for communication and planning.
