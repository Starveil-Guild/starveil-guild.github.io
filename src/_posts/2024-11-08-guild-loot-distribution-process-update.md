Weâ€™re lucky to have a core group of honest folks! ðŸŒŸ As we grow, setting up processes to prevent bad actors from gaming the system will benefit everyone. To this end, a new loot eligibility requirements have been added: **Your target build details must be added to the [member roster](https://discord.com/channels/1292680546916372530/1292681234304204913/1304515086831845457)**

The original raid schedule sheet is updated to serve as a general roster that includes information about your target build.

All target build data is required, including the link to your build on [maxroll.gg](https://maxroll.gg/throne-and-liberty/build-guides). This info will be used to assess your need for specific items. If your build information isnâ€™t on the roster when a loot thread closes, youâ€™ll be passed up on the rollâ€”even if you would have otherwise won.

Note: Your build choice will be locked in for three weeks to prevent members from changing roles on the fly to obtain items they want but donâ€™t need.

For full eligibility requirements and more details on the lock-in period, please see the [Guild and Loot Distribution](/docs/guild-loot-and-distribution) process document.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!

Thanks, @everyone!
